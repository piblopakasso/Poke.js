# Poke

Hi! :hand:

This is a relatively small home project the main idea of which was to develop my skills in React and widely used
technologies at the same time in programming overall. I thought that it would be interesting to base the project on
something fun and adorable. Once I found out that there exists a website/API that suits me, and it is about Pokémon,
it was not necessary to search anything else. As a result, I believe it was a successful choice. :relaxed:  

## What were used here?

- Base :muscle:
  - [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/ "PokeAPI Homepage")

    The API for accessing tons of highly detailed data on the basis of the 'Pokémon' video game franchise.


- Fetching :fishing_pole_and_fish:
  - [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest "TanStack Query Homepage")

    To help me deal with all tasks where fetching was involved.

    
- Routing :airplane:
  - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main "React Router Homepage")

    To make routing easier and more efficient.


- Styling :shirt:
  - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/ "Styled Components Homepage")

    To change working with CSS in a more enjoyable way. 

 
- Code Formating :triangular_ruler:
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/ "Prettier Homepage")

    To format all the written code to meet nice-looking standards.


(Probably, the next parts of this file won`t be very useful for anybody, still they look nice, so I decided to keep them) :wink:
